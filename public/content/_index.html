Cyanobyte is a specification that defines the types of hardware configurations and functions that
a hardware peripheral can have.

With a standardized representation, a codegen tool can read the intermediate representation and
convert it into an executable driver in the language and platform of your choice.

Think of it as a machine-readable datasheet. By placing not just registers, but logic into a
static configration, you don't need to worry about converting a temperature sensor into Celsius,
or finding the exact register values to initialize your device. All the logic is handled for you.

This is an open spec, and we're looking for more feedback.
