  How do we build this site?

Cyanobyte's devsite uses [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) as the theme, with Hugo as the underlying
engine.

I recommend following the [Docsy Getting Started guide](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/) to know how to get started.

Run `cd public && hugo serve` to serve at http://localhost:1313.

Run `hugo && firebase deploy` to generate and deploy the site.
