  And other items to consider?
---

- I2C
  - How do we deal with addresses that are configurable?
  - How do we support sequential register reads for certain chips?
- SPI
- UART
  - How do we support the common methods for encoding data sent over UART? Do we make the specification extendable with custom extensions and plugins in the codegen?
- USB
  - Do we want to even attempt this?
